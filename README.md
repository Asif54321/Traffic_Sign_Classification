# Traffic_Sign_Classification

Train and classify Traffic Signs using Convolutional neural networks This will be done using OPENCV in real time using a simple webcam . CNNs have been gaining popularity in the past couple of years due to their ability to generalize and classify the data with high accuracy. In this project we will train traffic signs with over 35000 images of 43 different classes with the help of tensorflow and keras .
